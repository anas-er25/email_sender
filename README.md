# Automated Email Sender with PDF Attachment

This Python script automates sending emails in bulk with a PDF attachment, using Gmail's SMTP service. It is designed to handle batching, delay management, and avoids triggering Gmail's spam detection by mimicking natural sending behavior.

## How to Generate a Gmail App Password

1. Log in to your Google Account.

## Notes

- **Email Limits**: Gmail has sending limits (e.g., 500 emails/day for regular accounts). Ensure your batch size and total email count comply with these limits.
- **Privacy**: Keep your Gmail credentials secure and do not share the script with sensitive information.

## Known Issues

- Some email addresses may reject the email if their servers identify the email as spam. To avoid this, use professional email-sending platforms if you need higher reliability.
- Ensure the PDF attachment path is valid; otherwise, the script will fail to attach the file.
